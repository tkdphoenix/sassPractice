# Sass Practice

The purpose of this project is to provide a reference for Sass styling, functions, and features of the Sass precompilation language.

## Setup with VS Code Plugin `Live Sass Compiler`
In this project I used a built-in precompiler library that works with VS Code text-editor called [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass#review-details). Instructions on how to watch code for changes are found in the link to the plugin. To create settings and direct where CSS compiles to, as well if it should be minified, or compressed follow the instructions on the [plugin GitHub repo](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-sass-compiler/blob/master/docs/settings.md).

## Options for Frameworks

There are other options available which work well to compile your Sass into CSS.

* [Susy](https://www.oddbird.net/susy/) - helps to define columns, gutters, and how grid layout should look
* [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/) - creates media queries for responsive design
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) - colors, typography, CSS3 helpers
